Look at some places on Craigslist. Realize they're all sketchy or way too expensive. Get confused about the differences and relative strengths of each neighborhood. Think to yourself, "Well, I suppose I could survive in Outer Richmond."

Keep looking at places. Think that the Tenderloin might be the only place affordable that's actually in the city. Try visiting and decide that living there would be a bad idea.

Stay in hostels for nights on end.

Cry.
