My boss told me today about this idea/business he used to have where every day you'd find something out about some stranger. In that spirit, I present to you Henry.

I met Henry waiting to check in at the hostel in downtown San Francisco. He's a biology person from Oxford, here to visit Northern California for a few days before a biology conference in Long Beach. Before this, he was chilling in Calgary (like a bro!).

His name might not be Henryâ€”I didn't actually ask him.

He studies cell membranes, and how to predict different membrane structures. This is important because I have no idea. It sounded cool. He does a lot of computational work, and thinks it's "an interesting introduction to programming." He doesn't have to do wet lab! Which he seems excited about.

Henry wore glasses, and was soft-spoken and friendly. I asked him if he was post-grad "or something" and he nodded.

Henry, what a guy.
