*(Throwback: the photo's from San Diego's Mission Beach in May. I haven't taken any photos of Virginia Beach.)*

So I'm in Virginia Beach! It feels so weird to leave San Franciso. Virginia Beach is a gorgeous place, but it's hard to beat running along the Embarcadero or ordering coffee from the friendly guy at the Civic Center Starbucks who always remembers me.

Wow, Yelp says that location serves the Tenderloin. Ulp.

Beaches on the East Coast are so much warmer than ones in California! It blows my mind. The waves were lame though, so, tradeoffs. I'll take California's freezing oceans and giant waves anyday.

I've been thinking a lot about how to manage (my own) creative work. I've latched on to the entirely unoriginal idea of making short to-do lists that I add to while working on them. This seems flexible enough, and it also keeps me focused on discrete items. If I run into a new idea while in the middle of a task, I can just add it to the list and continue without breaking stride.

Of course the problem with to-do lists is getting in the habit of applying them to all of your problems, not just the ones that are particularly amenable to that solution. Then, even harder, coming up with to-do schedules that work both for me *and* my boss. Scary.

Also I was going to post a link to an awesome article about the need for self-actualization and how it relates to entrepreneurship, but instead I started reading [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/u-va-board-appoints-interim-leader-mcdonnell-to-talk-with-reporters/2012/06/19/gJQAHAJ3nV_story.html?tid=pm_local_pop) and got mad at the phrase, "in a marathon session." Did the entire board of UVA just run 26 miles? Most likely no.

Sloppy journalese is sloppy.

I like beaches.
