Stereotypical Instagrammed photo of Dolores Park. Nice and foggy today.

Why are stores organized the way they are? I went to Walgreens today to get a toilet plunger, and it was with the rest of your general cleaning supplies.

I didn't need any other cleaning supplies, I just wanted to fix a stuck toilet. What would have been more useful would be air freshener, or maybe more toilet paper or stomach medicine.

What if stores were designed to accommodate user stories? It might convince consumers to buy more stuff each visit.
