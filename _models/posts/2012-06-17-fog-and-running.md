Just had a gorgeous run along the waterfront, with the fog coming in and everything. This city is such a strange mélange: from the tall buildings of Embarcadero, past the cliffs of Telegraph Hill, through the crowds of awkard tourists at Fisherman's Wharf, to the foggy peace of Fort Mason, and back through the cozy tree-covered streetlamp-lit streets of Nob Hill. The droning cable car tracks led me back home.

I saw a great quote at NikeWorld at Union Square yesterday: "If you have a body, you are an athelete." — Bill Bowerman. If you ever find yourself needing for inspiration, get over to your closest Nike Store, that shit's great.
