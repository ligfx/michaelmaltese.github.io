I've spent this last weekend in Virginia Beach for my cousin's wedding (congratulations Michelle Bonarji n√©e Stern!), surrounded by my extended family and friends of my cousin.

When I was younger, I never thought much about the "real world," and what it was like to be an adult. Now I'm halfway through college, haven't really lived at home in more than two years, and I've got a job in one of the hippest cities in America.

It feels an awful lot like I'm growing up. How did that happen? I still remember meeting my roommate on the first day of college.

I see various family members starting relationships, complaining about jobs, making money, drinking a lot, frolicking in the waves, answering work email on the beach, and grilling dinner for other people. They all seem, to various degrees, happy.

Is this success?
