I just updated [The Student Life website](http://tsl.pomona.edu), finally posting the set of [community guidelines](http://tsl.pomona.edu/pages/about#community-guidelines) we've been working on. Ocassionally comment threads get heated, especially on articles about race, sex, or politics. One complaint I heard was that commenters felt that there wasn't any positive moderation, so the trolls took over the threads. We're now more actively moderating the comments to encourage positive, healthy discussions.

The new guidelines are as follows:

> *Be a good person*. The Consortium is a nice place. We are nice people. Debate the ideas, not the person.

> If you attack another person, we will ask you to edit or remove your comment. If you don't respond, we don't have an easy way to contact you, or you refuse, we will edit or remove the comment ourselves.

> If you are a spambot, we will remove your comments. This means you, "second hand cars manchester"!

> If you believe we have erred or would like to talk about these guidelines, you can contact us anytime at [digitaleditor@tsl.pomona.edu](mailto:digitaleditor@tsl.pomona.edu).

And May the Fourth be with you!
