Wow. Just, mind blown. Waiting for Godot, the entertainer being whipped is us as happy kids growing up into scared adults. What happened to us? Humans are dancers, let's feel what it means to just move. Some guy brought a bunch of Pygmies to San Francisco once and had them dance. They danced for nine hours straight. The audience was crazy about it. The Pygmies weren't "doing a dance" they were just doing their thing. Life is improvisation. We don't plan out everything we do all day it's about reacting to things in the moment as they come up. Improvisation is about being more in the moment, and not thinking ahead/trying to plan so much. Strict attention to time is a silly thing it's so arbitrary just go with life. Humans as kids always try to imitate the movement of animals, we try to act like we're animals, they know something we don't. We've made life easier on ourselves and forgotten that we are body and mind, not just mind. Live through your body. If you're intense about one thing, you can use that to become intense about anything. Can you really? Maybe. The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. Do what you're intense about, what makes you feel alive. Maybe we already know everything we need to know and don't need to go to college. Writing teaches you to talk to yourself with wordsâ€”try talking to yourself without words instead.
