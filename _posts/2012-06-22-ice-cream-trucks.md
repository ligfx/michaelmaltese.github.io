(This is my sister's photo. She's [an amazing photographer](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Margaret-Maltese-Photography/264915376899676)!)

Today, my sister and I chased an ice-cream truck five blocks. In the pouring rain. In a thunderstorm. We bought nine ice-creams with soaked, crumpled-up dollar bills, then ran all the way back.

Life is about the stories you make.
