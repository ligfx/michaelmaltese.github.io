Watched the fog rolling in over the bay last night with some guys up on Grizzly Peak, above Berkeley. It's absolutely beautiful. It looks almost like water the way it spills over the hills. Being in San Francisco, the fog is ever present, overhead and invisible against your skin. It's refreshing getting out and being able to watch it from afar.

Isn't it funny how we talk about directions? "Left" and "right" are such arbitrary measures. If I say something's "to the left of Coit Tower," that's meaningless. It could be West from the Marina, South from the waterfront, or even towards Berkeley from Fisherman's Wharf.

"North" and "South" are better direction markers, because they're absolute. If I say some object is "North", it remains the same direction no matter where I am in relation to the object. Some languages even use compass directions to refer to all directions. They might say, "Put your southwest foot in," where we would say, "Put your right foot in." It gives them an amazing ability to stay oriented and know where they are in relation to landmarks.

The compass directions have one major failing though: they don't line up with all street grids. I wouldn't be comfortable telling someone to East or West on Market St., but being accurate and saying Northeast and Southwest feels too cumbersome. Or take Geary St., which borders one side of the famous Union Square (home to Saks Fifth Ave): it travels from West-Southwest to East-Northeast.

Maybe we need compass directions oriented for each grid. Instead of going North-Northwest on Van Ness, I could go "Upper San Francisco North," which would be understood as lining up with the grid on the Northern part of the city.

Actually that sounds ridiculous.

(Are compass directions capitalized? I can never remember and it's stressing me out.)
