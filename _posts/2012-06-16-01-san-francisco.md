I’m working at [Chute Corporation](http://getchute.com) in the South of Market neighborhood (SoMa) in San Francisco this summer, from June 11th until August 17th. I grew up in a small rural town, and I attend college in the suburban outskirts of Los Angeles county. This will be the first time in my life living in a really big city.

I’m excited:)
