70% of 18&ndash;29 year-olds have downloaded content illegally, according to [this probably totally legit infographic](http://ansonalex.com/infographics/online-piracy-statistics-2012-infographic/). That's a lot of college students and Gen Y-ers.

So why are people breaking copyright law? The Oatmeal [is spot on in it's analysis](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones). It's not that people hate artists and are greedy/hippies. Large content networks seem to actively make it difficult to get the stuff we want.

Case in point, check out the people [complaining on](https://twitter.com/NBCLiveFail) [the internet](https://twitter.com/search/%23nbcfail) [right now](http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2012/07/28/nbc-takes-beating-olympics-coverage/10053/) about NBC's exclusive right to broadcast the Olympics in the United States.

A big complaint is that it's actually impossible to buy the media we want, or that it's priced way too high.

The last time I looked at Doctor Who on iTunes, I remember a season being a ridiculous amount of money. How much should an episode of a show cost? Surely not more than a few dollars.

Then my friend pointed out that the SD versions of TV shows on iTunes and Amazon cost less than the HD versions. Sure it will look and sound a little worse, but if you're already watching it on a laptop then you probably don't care. Season 2 of [Suits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_\(TV_series\)) on Amazon will cost you [something around $25](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008POAQS4/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8), and you can stream it and download it to your Kindle Fire (wtf moment: why can't I download it to my computer?). iTunes will cost you a straight [$25 for the season pass](http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/suits-season-2/id529032817), and you can download it, stream it to your Apple TV, whatever.

If you're in college and watching TV shows with multiple friends, how does $8 a person a season sound? How low do prices need to be for people to start paying for quality content? The iTunes option is pretty attractive. (And I'm a huge sucker for Suits!)

*If you're more interested in hard numbers on piracy, you might like the [2012 IFPI Digital Music Report](http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2012.pdf). I couldn't find anything more official, or anything on media piracy as a whole.*

*By the way, if you're trying to stream the Olympics, it's illegal if you're not a UK citizen but people have been using VPN services like [TunnelBear](http://www.tunnelbear.com/) to access the BBC. Don't break the law.*
