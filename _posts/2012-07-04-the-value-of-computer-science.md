*Happy Birthday America! Celebrating by staying inside, watching James Bond, Will Smith, and Bruce Willis, and recovering from this sucky food poisoning.*

Computer Science is now [Stanford's most popular major](http://mashable.com/2012/07/01/stanford-top-major-computer-science/), which makes a lot of sense, considering the proximity to Silicon Valley and the rising popularity of the tech startups.

Do we want our best and brightest young minds going into the tech world? I see articles complaining about the "Wall Street Brain Drain"â€”the top college grads who enter finance and consulting instead of doing something with more value to society. I'm not sure how much value the average tech startup adds to the world.

On the other hand, McKinsey predicts a shortage of up to 190,000 people with "deep analytical talent" by 2016, and computer science grads from one of the top computer science schools in the country (if not the world) will be well-positioned to fill that need. Deep analytical talent certainly has the capacity to change the world for the better.

What's the social value of more computer science majors?

*And now back to Live Free or Die Hard, which funnily enough has computer hackers as both heroes and villians. Man I love Bruce Willis.*
