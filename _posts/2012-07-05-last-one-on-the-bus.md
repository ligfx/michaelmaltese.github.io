It's strange being the last one on the bus, being suddenly alone in the middle of the endless cityscape.

With no one else aboard, a bus seems less a machine and more a living object, a great creature of fire and metal roaring along the dark canyons and the forgotten spaces of the city. A bus is never in one single placeâ€”it a connector of spaces. It is a wormhole, a traveling discontinuity, a tenuous thread connecting the nooks and crannies of the night.

This glowing, smoke-belching monster carries you up the hills and down the valleys, around unseen obstacles, past other lit islands moving in the night. It jerks to a halt on some dark corner, bidding you, the last rider, a good  night, then rushes off to places unknown. It slides quickly behind and between the nooks and crannies in the night and is gone.

Where does this creature run off to in the night?
