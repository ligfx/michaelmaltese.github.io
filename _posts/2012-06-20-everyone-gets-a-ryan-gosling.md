I'm off to Virginia in five hours for my cousin's wedding. It's going to be a blast: having fun with cousins, going to a wedding, and enjoying the beautiful weather.

The TV behind me is on some sports game and they're playing Kernkraft 400. Completely inappropriate for 1AM in a quiet suburb in Cupertino.

So my cousin's getting married, which is awesome, because she's awesome, and her guy seems awesome, and I'm sure they'll be awesomely happy together. How do people even go about getting married? Whenever I start thinking about relationships I read essays from ThoughtCatalog, which are unceasingly dark and brooding and always make me feel better about my life. Everyone else is crazy too. Here's a funny quote:

"Kiss like you’re a starved animal. Imagine you’re kissing a birthday cake, a sno-cone, a Ryan Gosling. Pour all of your attention into the kiss like you’re a conductor leading a makeout orchestra."

A Ryan Gosling.

*You* get a Ryan Gosling, *you* get a Ryan Gosling, *everyone* gets a Ryan Gosling! And then we're going down to the local bar and pretending like we're the Chicago Philharmonic.

P.S. Also I appreciate quiet green places a lot more after a week and a half in the city. I need to start waking up earlier and enjoying the mornings.
