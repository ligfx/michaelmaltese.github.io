Today I went and looked at a studio apartment in Lower Nob Hill. Good price, inside of building was just redone, gorgeous kitchen, amazing rooftop patio.

Unfortunately, landlords and brokers aren't really looking for two month leases, no matter how friendly the college student is.

The guy mentioned that the apartment was in the "Tendernob," the point where the gentrification of Nob Hill hits the sketchiness of the Tenderloin. He told me the Tenderloin was fine, it was just weird crack addicts.

Tonight I ran along the edge of the Tenderloin to get to the 24 Hour Fitness on Van Ness. Sketchy? A little bit. Worth freaking out about? Eh.

P.S. 24 Hour Fitness is the bomb
