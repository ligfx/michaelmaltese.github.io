It's easy to forget who you are.

We get so caught up in our daily obligations and the pressure we put on ourselves that we become basically zombies. You need to take back your time, relax, and remember that you're a human being.

Going for a run reminds me of myself. I have memories of myself running all the way back through high school, and with them images of who I was. Sophomore year, when I joined cross country, I was a tall gangly geek with big hair. Freshman year in college, I went running in the hot summer air the first night with other new students. A few weeks ago, I ran up the waterfront and remember seeing across the bay to Berkeley for the first time.

You're not defined by your boring routine. You're not the person who works 9-5, or does homework on Friday nights, or stays in and watches television instead of going out and meeting people. You are an amazing amalgam of experiences and memories. Do things that make you remember that.

You are not a zombie.
