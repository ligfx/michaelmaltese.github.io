*Image from my uncle's house back in May. Surprisingly I don't have any hipster Instagrammed photos of coffee. I know, I'm ashamed.*

I have 27 stars. Three more and I reach Gold Level! Also I like the idea of breakfast items at Starbucks, because I like going to Starbucks, but the quality is really just not there yet.

I enjoy getting to 9th and Market early and stopping at Starbucks. I chat with the baristas, grab some coffee (dark roast, no sweetener, half-and-half), sometimes food, sometimes the New York Times, and sit at the window and peoplewatch for a half hour before going to work.

Absinthe contains stinging nettles?
