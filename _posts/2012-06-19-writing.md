(One of the cool things about [this blog software](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) is that posts can be published whenever I want. Was this actually written on Tuesday? Nope.)

I've decided to follow in the steps of my friend [Jesse Pollak](http://jessepollak.me/) and blog every day this summer. Jesse's a great guy, brilliant developer, working at BuzzFeed for HackNY this summer.

Writing blog entries is tough. I'm much more used to journalistic writing, where the sentences are simple and the facts are clear. Blogging is a different type of writing: I'm not trying to convey a series of facts, but rather some muddled snapshot of what's in my head at the time.

Another awesome person you should follow is Lauren Moon, who blogs at [Lauren Is Twenty-Something](http://laurenistwentysomething.blogspot.com/)! Basically she's an amazing writer. I think she's doing like five million unpaid internships in the entertainment industry this summer, or something. What a boss.
