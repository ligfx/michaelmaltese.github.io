See what that frisbee says? *Claremont Ultimate - Braineaters - Greenshirts*.

I spent the afternoon at Dolores Park (the place with all of the Instagrammed photos of the San Francisco skyline) at an intern party sponsored by [InternMatch](http://internmatch.com). Basically they're awesome, and Dolores Park is awesome, and meeting other people my age in San Francisco is awesome, and I got really sunburned which is not so awesome.

We were tossing a frisbee around and I happened to drop it and read the top. This guy Will Barbour knows Abe McKay, a year above me at Pomona.

How did I get sunburned?
