	          <h2>EXCLUSIVE!!! Behind the Scenes at Iron Frank</h2>
				<p>First round of Apple-icants Whittled
						Down to the Core Four</p>

	        <div class="entry">
	          <p>In celebration of Frank’s new apple slicing station, the first secret ingredient for the much
						talked about Iron Frank competition was apple. Seven teams submitted their best apple inspired
						dishes to five judges, including our very own Maddy Jenks and Chloe Webster, who will act
						as the Chancellor and came armed with an iron. Four dishes reigned supreme, meeting and
						exceeding the established criteria of presentation, creativity, and, of course, taste. Crapplenut
						sushi was served up with an April Fool’s twist; at first the team’s submission was the product
						of performance art in which one of the chefs bite an apple and presented it to the judges. But
						the actual dish was delicious dessert take on the tradition Japanese savory fare, and took home
						the first prize for creativity. In addition, the panel was treated to apple crumble with home-
						made whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon and garnished with raspberries, an apple soufflé
						served inside a whole apple and paired with bacon and goat cheese stuffed apple wontons, all
						drizzled with apple reduction, and pumpkin pancakes with apple cider syrup, and ice cream,
						presented with an apple beautifully carved into a swan. Honorable mentions go to baked brie
						with homemade apple butter, mini apple pies, and a baked apple. Our sincere complements and
						thanks to the Iron Frank competitors for providing us with the best meal we’ve eaten at Frank in
						a long long time.</p>

          <h2>Pleased to MEAT You</h2>
			<p>Unpopular Menu Changes at Frary Bring Diverse Crowd to Frank</p>
          <small>Monday, February 21st, 2011</small>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <p>	While lots of vegetarian and &ldquo;flexitarian&rdquo; Pomona students applaud Frary’s animal rights
			and environmentally friendly Meatless Monday program, an under-represented group of
			Pomona upperclassmen have been forced to decamp to a dining hall that MEATS their carnal
			requirements. Increased lines for Frank’s unremarkable Monday lunch were explained by
			murmurs of unrest from Frank’s new and atypical crowd. Clearly not used to having to hunt for
			their meat, the displaced Frary patrons were hopeful that their patience in line would be rewarded
			with an abundance of carnivorous choices. While your faithful reporters appreciated the new
			crowd and their enthusiastic attitude, some were less tolerant. One representative of the Frank
			vox populi took the issue to the comment board abjuring: &ldquo;No CMC Bros.&rdquo; The sentiment was
			seconded by the addition of a facebook style “like” While we support the free expression of
			opinions, we have to ask: is the comment board the place for hate speech and slurs against well-
			meaning Pomona meat lovers?</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/collectivelyfrank/cmc-bros.jpg" /></p>

		<p>	<strong>Spotted:</strong> On February 12th, Saturday brunch, table of older gentlemen with no apparent
			affiliation with Pomona College, enjoying Frank’s omelet bar and other brunch options while
			blasting “Let’s Get It On.”</p>
		<p>	<strong>News Items:</strong> On Taco Tuesday, February 15th, the Breakfast Blend Coffee at Frank tasted
			curiously similar to vodka. Part of a Workers for Justice protest? Or has Sam finally taken
			notice of the multiple and, we can only assume, sincere comments requesting something to make
			the Frank fare go down a bit, shall we say, easier. Either way, grateful Pomona students looking
			to DAF (drink at Frank) enjoyed a new take on espresso “shots.”</p>

		<p>Yours collectively,<br/>

          <h2>Has Frank Gone NUTS?</h2>
			<p>Keep Abstinence Out of Our Dining Halls!</p>
          <small>Monday, February 14th, 2011</small>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <p>Frank dining hall prides itself on serving a number of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options.  But one group of Pomona students has been neglected.  On February 2nd, one Frank patron with serious allergies was left with little to eat due to an inexplicable quantity of cashew and other tree nuts incorporated into the Frank dinner fare.  Munching on his lettuce, this young gentleman had only the thought of spending time with his lovely girlfriend to keep his spirits up.  But in a truly unfortunate turn of events, the cashew nuts would strike again later that night at snack, this time not only affecting his dining choices, but also his much looked forward to prospects of intimacy.  At an unusually disappointing pub snack, already questionable Indian food had even more questionable ingredients.  What were those crunchy nibs mixed in with the neither sweet nor savory rice dish, which we hesitate to call pilaf?  Were they, as his astute girlfriend suspected, the dreaded cashew nuts?  The lack of labels at snack, an oversight which often goes unnoticed, means that we will never know.  But one thing we do know is that the already beleaguered and hungry Pomona student would not be risking a kiss of death that night.</p>

          <h2>Déjà Saw</h2>
			<p>Frequent Frank Trespasser Raises the STEAKS</p>
          <small>Tuesday, February 1st, 2011</small>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <p>If you're a Frank regular, you may be familiar with a fur coated young gentleman who frequently hops the fence to enjoy Frank's riches.  It was certainly no shock to us when around 5:15 PM he jumped into the courtyard and entered the main dining room.  Upon further inspection, however, it came to our attention that he had brought a dangerous weapon into our beloved Frank.  We know Frank's meat might not be the most tender, but was a hacksaw really necessary?  Furthermore, does such a utensil have the potential to disturb the loving family style atmosphere that patrons expect of a Frank dining experience?  Does his stealing go beyond Frank meals to include bicycles of Pomona students on the go?  Or was he simply attempting to remove an inconvenient branch which was getting in the way of his alternative path to Frank?</p>

		<p><strong>Spotted:</strong> A group of rowdy Pomona freshmen on the Blaisdell roof heavily armed with immaturity and water balloons targeting innocent passersby attempting to make their way to Frank.</p>

		<p><strong>News items:</strong> Around 12:00 PM taco tuesday, the soda machine lost carbonation capabilities, but the situation was quickly remedied with what we're calling the &ldquo;Frank Method&rdquo; of jamming down the Coke and Hawaiian punch spouts simultaneously.  A big thank you to the ingenious Frank employee from Pomona's carbonated beverage drinkers.  For those of you worried about the health and safety of your delicious Frank meals, we have good news.  Frank's rating was recently updated to a perfect A.  Congratulations, Frank, we knew you could do it!</p>
		
		<p><strong>Update:</strong> At last night's snack, we witnessed a possible solution to the &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; posse's inappropriate behavior.  One boy on line (who is not at all affiliated with the posse) proudly proclaimed that he had brought his own bowl.  Now that's a green idea we can all get behind!</p>

          <h2>SNACK ATTACK</h2>
			<p>&ldquo;Sustainable&rdquo; Posse Double Dips NACH-YO Cheese at Snack</p>
          <small>Monday, January 31st, 2011</small>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
          <p>Around 11:12 PM at Frary Hall, a group of 4 or 5 youths were seen huddling around the nacho cheese vat, creating a severe bottleneck and, to the awe of your faithful reporters, hand dipping individual tortilla chips into the communal nacho cheese.  As we watched with shock and horror their extended faux pas, one particular offender came out of the woodwork as the ringleader, making eye contact and continuing to dip into the communal vat with abandon.  After they'd had their fill, nary an individual bowl in sight, the ringleader approached us, and put the attack in snack attack.  Smirking, he asked, "Wanna nacho?"  Luckily, we restrained ourselves and prevented a volatile situation, answering, with just the right amount of disgust at his sardonic offer, a simple "No."   So, new readers, weigh in!  Should snack be treated like a cocktail party?</p>
