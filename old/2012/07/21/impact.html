<p><em>I'm writing this on the train down to Palo Alto. One of my good friends is running Wharf to Wharf this weekend, so I'm going out there with him and watching the race!</em></p>

<p>Let's talk about impact. I heard someone say recently that the Silicon Valley is egalitarian because "hackers" treat everyone as peers.</p>

<p>Something's wrong with that statement.</p>

<p>In San Francisco I see homeless people every single day. This doesn't seem very egalitarian. There's a huge amount (you may think it's a long walk to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space!) of money flowing into the Silicon Valley, but just for the tech industry. Investors will put tens of millions of dollars into a new social network for cats on skateboards while, like any urban area, other people are languishing in poverty.</p>

<p>Something's wrong with this.</p>

<p>Tech adds value to the world. Smart people should get money to come up with smart ideas. But I don't think this scales (that's startup jargon, by the way: it's cool that you can do something, but you can do something that scales?).</p>

<p>Pundits have complained that the smartest minds of our generation are going into finance or selling ads. I think the tech bubble is similar. Smart, entrepeneurially-minded young people are being drawn into an industry that, as a whole, is being far too much money for things far too petty.</p>

<p>Let's see that money going to better use.</p>
