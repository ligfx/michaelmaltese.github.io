	<p class="meta">28 Jul 2012 &ndash; San Francisco</p>

<p>70% of 18&ndash;29 year-olds have downloaded content illegally, according to <a href="http://ansonalex.com/infographics/online-piracy-statistics-2012-infographic/">this probably totally legit infographic</a>. That's a lot of college students and Gen Y-ers.</p>

<p>So why are people breaking copyright law? The Oatmeal <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones">is spot on in it's analysis</a>. It's not that people hate artists and are greedy/hippies. Large content networks seem to actively make it difficult to get the stuff we want.</p>

<p>Case in point, check out the people <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCLiveFail">complaining on</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23nbcfail">the internet</a> <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2012/07/28/nbc-takes-beating-olympics-coverage/10053/">right now</a> about NBC's exclusive right to broadcast the Olympics in the United States.</p>

<p>A big complaint is that it's actually impossible to buy the media we want, or that it's priced way too high.</p>

<p>The last time I looked at Doctor Who on iTunes, I remember a season being a ridiculous amount of money. How much should an episode of a show cost? Surely not more than a few dollars.</p>

<p>Then my friend pointed out that the SD versions of TV shows on iTunes and Amazon cost less than the HD versions. Sure it will look and sound a little worse, but if you're already watching it on a laptop then you probably don't care. Season 2 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(TV_series)">Suits</a> on Amazon will cost you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008POAQS4/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8">something around $25</a>, and you can stream it and download it to your Kindle Fire (wtf moment: why can't I download it to my computer?). iTunes will cost you a straight <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/suits-season-2/id529032817">$25 for the season pass</a>, and you can download it, stream it to your Apple TV, whatever.</p>

<p>If you're in college and watching TV shows with multiple friends, how does $8 a person a season sound? How low do prices need to be for people to start paying for quality content? The iTunes option is pretty attractive. (And I'm a huge sucker for Suits!)</p>

<p><em>If you're more interested in hard numbers on piracy, you might like the <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2012.pdf">2012 IFPI Digital Music Report</a>. I couldn't find anything more official, or anything on media piracy as a whole.</em></p>

<p><em>By the way, if you're trying to stream the Olympics, it's illegal if you're not a UK citizen but people have been using VPN services like <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a> to access the BBC. Don't break the law.</em></p>
