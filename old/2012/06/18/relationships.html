<p>(I've walked past this mural every day so far on my way to work)</p>

<p>My school wants to know how to brand itself. I took a group call with other current students and an external marketing research group. The researcher asked us questions like, "Academics?", and "Are you a New England college?", and, my favorite, "What do Pomona students care about?"</p>

<p>What do Pomona students care about? I can't help but feel that if the college has to hire an external party to figure this out, they're doing something wrong.</p>

<p>I had a great conversation with one of my bosses at <a href="http://getchute.com">Chute</a> about his sales strategy. He said, essentially, that he was in the business of forming strong relationships with people. Strong relationships build a strong company.</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of complaints students have with the administration comes down to a lack of good relationships. The outcry about the documentation checks and administration accountability at the end of Fall semester were worsened because students don't feel connected with parts of the administration.</p>

<p>At the end of the call, someone else added something I really identified with. They said that Pomona could stand to loosen the reigns and let its students have a bigger impact on the school and community. The Motley at Scripps is student-run, does what it wants, lets students paint all over its walls.</p>

<p>I've always wanted to paint the walls on something at Pomona.</p>

<p>Today at work I made pretty (and useful) graphs. San Francisco fuck yeah!</p>
