    <blockquote>
      <p>Africa now earns an average of 24 per cent of its annual growth from its farmers and their crops. If matched with more electricity and irrigation, smart business and trade policies and a dynamic private agribusiness sector that works side by side with government to link farmers with consumers in an increasingly urbanized Africa, the World Bank estimates that agriculture and agribusiness together could command a US$ 1 trillion presence in Africa’s regional economy by 2030</p>

		<h1><a href="">Suits and Capitalist Media Consumption</a></h1>
		<div class="post-body">
			<p><img src="/images/amazon-suits.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>70% of 18&ndash;29 year-olds have downloaded content illegally, according to <a href="http://ansonalex.com/infographics/online-piracy-statistics-2012-infographic/">this probably totally legit infographic</a>. That&#8217;s a lot of college students and Gen Y-ers.</p>

<p>So why are people breaking copyright law? The Oatmeal <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones">is spot on in it&#8217;s analysis</a>. It&#8217;s not that people hate artists and are greedy/hippies. Large content networks seem to actively make it difficult to get the stuff we want.</p>

<p>Case in point, check out the people <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCLiveFail">complaining on</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23nbcfail">the internet</a> <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2012/07/28/nbc-takes-beating-olympics-coverage/10053/">right now</a> about NBC&#8217;s exclusive right to broadcast the Olympics in the United States.</p>

<p>A big complaint is that it&#8217;s actually impossible to buy the media we want, or that it&#8217;s priced way too high.</p>

<p>The last time I looked at Doctor Who on iTunes, I remember a season being a ridiculous amount of money. How much should an episode of a show cost? Surely not more than a few dollars.</p>

<p>Then my friend pointed out that the SD versions of TV shows on iTunes and Amazon cost less than the HD versions. Sure it will look and sound a little worse, but if you&#8217;re already watching it on a laptop then you probably don&#8217;t care. Season 2 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_\(TV_series\)">Suits</a> on Amazon will cost you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008POAQS4/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8">something around $25</a>, and you can stream it and download it to your Kindle Fire (wtf moment: why can&#8217;t I download it to my computer?). iTunes will cost you a straight <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/suits-season-2/id529032817">$25 for the season pass</a>, and you can download it, stream it to your Apple TV, whatever.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in college and watching TV shows with multiple friends, how does $8 a person a season sound? How low do prices need to be for people to start paying for quality content? The iTunes option is pretty attractive. (And I&#8217;m a huge sucker for Suits!)</p>

<p><em>If you&#8217;re more interested in hard numbers on piracy, you might like the <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2012.pdf">2012 IFPI Digital Music Report</a>. I couldn&#8217;t find anything more official, or anything on media piracy as a whole.</em></p>

<p><em>By the way, if you&#8217;re trying to stream the Olympics, it&#8217;s illegal if you&#8217;re not a UK citizen but people have been using VPN services like <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a> to access the BBC. Don&#8217;t break the law.</em></p>

		<h1><a href="">Impact</a></h1>
		<div class="post-body">
			<p><img src="/images/sf-ring-sculpture.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>I&#8217;m writing this on the train down to Palo Alto. One of my good friends is running Wharf to Wharf this weekend, so I&#8217;m going out there with him and watching the race!</em></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s talk about impact. I heard someone say recently that the Silicon Valley is egalitarian because &#8220;hackers&#8221; treat everyone as peers.</p>

<p>Something&#8217;s wrong with that statement.</p>

<p>In San Francisco I see homeless people every single day. This doesn&#8217;t seem very egalitarian. There&#8217;s a huge amount (you may think it&#8217;s a long walk to the chemist&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s just peanuts to space!) of money flowing into the Silicon Valley, but just for the tech industry. Investors will put tens of millions of dollars into a new social network for cats on skateboards while, like any urban area, other people are languishing in poverty.</p>

<p>Something&#8217;s wrong with this.</p>

<p>Tech adds value to the world. Smart people should get money to come up with smart ideas. But I don&#8217;t think this scales (that&#8217;s startup jargon, by the way: it&#8217;s cool that you can do something, but you can do something that scales?).</p>

<p>Pundits have complained that the smartest minds of our generation are going into finance or selling ads. I think the tech bubble is similar. Smart, entrepeneurially-minded young people are being drawn into an industry that, as a whole, is being far too much money for things far too petty.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see that money going to better use.</p>

		<h1><a href="">How I Won 100GB For Life On Dropbox</a></h1>
		<div class="post-body">
			<p><img src="/images/photo-hack-day.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last Saturday and Sunday I attended <a href="http://www.photohackday.org/">Photo Hack Day 3</a>, at the Dropbox headquarters. A bunch of awesome photo and video API producers sponsored it, including Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, Dropbox, and Walgreens (who provided the snacks, thanks Walgreens!). Each sponsor had a prize for their favorite hack.</p>

<p>Dropbox was also giving away 10GB for life to anyone who used their API, so I put together a small app. My app <em>Fieldbox</em>, which displayed Camera Uploads from their mobile app for multiple users at once, ended up winning the top Dropbox prize: 100GB for life! </p>

<p>Here are some things I think I did well:</p>

<h2 id="solve-a-real-problem">Solve a real problem</h2>

<p>The idea for Fieldbox came out of a situation that&#8217;s frustrated me before. Imagine you&#8217;re a news media organization, and an event happens that you want to cover in real time. Some reporters are there with smartphones, but how do they quickly and easily get the photos to an editor to post with an article?</p>

<p>The Dropbox mobile app has this awesome feature where 1. You open it, and 2. It uploads all of your photos and videos to Dropbox. Quick and easy!</p>

<p>Fieldbox would allow someone on a computer to see all of the photos being uploaded, in quasi-realtime. Much better than the current situation.</p>

<h2 id="concentrate-on-the-minimum-viable-product">Concentrate on the minimum viable product</h2>

<p>I hard-coded OAuth tokens into the code. There, I confess! In multiple places, no less. An 12-hour prototype doesn&#8217;t need user management or authentication hooks.</p>

<p>A usable product requires a lot of things that a prototype doesn&#8217;t, so don&#8217;t waste time making features that don&#8217;t matter.</p>

<h2 id="stay-up-for-thirty-six-hours">Stay up for thirty-six hours</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m kidding, this is <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/">a terrible idea</a>.</p>

<p>We also picked up some leftover snacks from Walgreens. Did I mention how awesome they are?</p>

<p>Ideas on what to do with 100GB of cloud storage now being accepted.</p>

		<div class="post-body">
			<p><img src="/images/sf-gloomy.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget who you are.</p>

<p>We get so caught up in our daily obligations and the pressure we put on ourselves that we become basically zombies. You need to take back your time, relax, and remember that you&#8217;re a human being.</p>

<p>Going for a run reminds me of myself. I have memories of myself running all the way back through high school, and with them images of who I was. Sophomore year, when I joined cross country, I was a tall gangly geek with big hair. Freshman year in college, I went running in the hot summer air the first night with other new students. A few weeks ago, I ran up the waterfront and remember seeing across the bay to Berkeley for the first time.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re not defined by your boring routine. You&#8217;re not the person who works 9-5, or does homework on Friday nights, or stays in and watches television instead of going out and meeting people. You are an amazing amalgam of experiences and memories. Do things that make you remember that.</p>

<p>You are not a zombie.</p>

<p>My boss told me today about this idea/business he used to have where every day you&#8217;d find something out about some stranger. In that spirit, I present to you Henry.</p>

<p>I met Henry waiting to check in at the hostel in downtown San Francisco. He&#8217;s a biology person from Oxford, here to visit Northern California for a few days before a biology conference in Long Beach. Before this, he was chilling in Calgary (like a bro!).</p>

<p>His name might not be Henry—I didn&#8217;t actually ask him.</p>

<p>He studies cell membranes, and how to predict different membrane structures. This is important because I have no idea. It sounded cool. He does a lot of computational work, and thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;an interesting introduction to programming.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t have to do wet lab! Which he seems excited about.</p>

<p>Henry wore glasses, and was soft-spoken and friendly. I asked him if he was post-grad &#8220;or something&#8221; and he nodded.</p>

<p>Henry, what a guy.</p>

		<h1><a href="">Compass Directions</a></h1>
		<div class="post-body">
			<p><img src="/images/berkeley-sunset.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Watched the fog rolling in over the bay last night with some guys up on Grizzly Peak, above Berkeley. It&#8217;s absolutely beautiful. It looks almost like water the way it spills over the hills. Being in San Francisco, the fog is ever present, overhead and invisible against your skin. It&#8217;s refreshing getting out and being able to watch it from afar.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it funny how we talk about directions? &#8220;Left&#8221; and &#8220;right&#8221; are such arbitrary measures. If I say something&#8217;s &#8220;to the left of Coit Tower,&#8221; that&#8217;s meaningless. It could be West from the Marina, South from the waterfront, or even towards Berkeley from Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf.</p>

<p>&#8220;North&#8221; and &#8220;South&#8221; are better direction markers, because they&#8217;re absolute. If I say some object is &#8220;North&#8221;, it remains the same direction no matter where I am in relation to the object. Some languages even use compass directions to refer to all directions. They might say, &#8220;Put your southwest foot in,&#8221; where we would say, &#8220;Put your right foot in.&#8221; It gives them an amazing ability to stay oriented and know where they are in relation to landmarks.</p>

<p>The compass directions have one major failing though: they don&#8217;t line up with all street grids. I wouldn&#8217;t be comfortable telling someone to East or West on Market St., but being accurate and saying Northeast and Southwest feels too cumbersome. Or take Geary St., which borders one side of the famous Union Square (home to Saks Fifth Ave): it travels from West-Southwest to East-Northeast.</p>

<p>Maybe we need compass directions oriented for each grid. Instead of going North-Northwest on Van Ness, I could go &#8220;Upper San Francisco North,&#8221; which would be understood as lining up with the grid on the Northern part of the city.</p>

<p>Actually that sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>(Are compass directions capitalized? I can never remember and it&#8217;s stressing me out.)</p>

<p><em>P.S. I swear, at some point I&#8217;m going to write a bunch of posts at once and catch up on the days I&#8217;ve missed!</em></p>

			<p><img src="/images/sf-turk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s strange being the last one on the bus, being suddenly alone in the middle of the endless cityscape.</p>

<p>With no one else aboard, a bus seems less a machine and more a living object, a great creature of fire and metal roaring along the dark canyons and the forgotten spaces of the city. A bus is never in one single place—it a connector of spaces. It is a wormhole, a traveling discontinuity, a tenuous thread connecting the nooks and crannies of the night.</p>

<p>This glowing, smoke-belching monster carries you up the hills and down the valleys, around unseen obstacles, past other lit islands moving in the night. It jerks to a halt on some dark corner, bidding you, the last rider, a good  night, then rushes off to places unknown. It slides quickly behind and between the nooks and crannies in the night and is gone.</p>

<p>Where does this creature run off to in the night?</p>

<p><em>Happy Birthday America! Celebrating by staying inside, watching James Bond, Will Smith, and Bruce Willis, and recovering from this sucky food poisoning.</em></p>

<p>Computer Science is now <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/01/stanford-top-major-computer-science/">Stanford&#8217;s most popular major</a>, which makes a lot of sense, considering the proximity to Silicon Valley and the rising popularity of the tech startups.</p>

<p>Do we want our best and brightest young minds going into the tech world? I see articles complaining about the &#8220;Wall Street Brain Drain&#8221;—the top college grads who enter finance and consulting instead of doing something with more value to society. I&#8217;m not sure how much value the average tech startup adds to the world.</p>

<p>On the other hand, McKinsey predicts a shortage of up to 190,000 people with &#8220;deep analytical talent&#8221; by 2016, and computer science grads from one of the top computer science schools in the country (if not the world) will be well-positioned to fill that need. Deep analytical talent certainly has the capacity to change the world for the better.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the social value of more computer science majors?</p>

<p>Why are stores organized the way they are? I went to Walgreens today to get a toilet plunger, and it was with the rest of your general cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t need any other cleaning supplies, I just wanted to fix a stuck toilet. What would have been more useful would be air freshener, or maybe more toilet paper or stomach medicine.</p>

<p>What if stores were designed to accommodate user stories? It might convince consumers to buy more stuff each visit.</p>

<p>I have 27 stars. Three more and I reach Gold Level! Also I like the idea of breakfast items at Starbucks, because I like going to Starbucks, but the quality is really just not there yet.</p>

<p>I enjoy getting to 9th and Market early and stopping at Starbucks. I chat with the baristas, grab some coffee (dark roast, no sweetener, half-and-half), sometimes food, sometimes the New York Times, and sit at the window and peoplewatch for a half hour before going to work.</p>

<p>Absinthe contains stinging nettles?</p>

<p>Today I went and looked at a studio apartment in Lower Nob Hill. Good price, inside of building was just redone, gorgeous kitchen, amazing rooftop patio.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, landlords and brokers aren&#8217;t really looking for two month leases, no matter how friendly the college student is.</p>

<p>The guy mentioned that the apartment was in the &#8220;Tendernob,&#8221; the point where the gentrification of Nob Hill hits the sketchiness of the Tenderloin. He told me the Tenderloin was fine, it was just weird crack addicts.</p>

<p>Tonight I ran along the edge of the Tenderloin to get to the 24 Hour Fitness on Van Ness. Sketchy? A little bit. Worth freaking out about? Eh.</p>

<p>P.S. 24 Hour Fitness is the bomb</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent this last weekend in Virginia Beach for my cousin&#8217;s wedding (congratulations Michelle Bonarji née Stern!), surrounded by my extended family and friends of my cousin.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I never thought much about the &#8220;real world,&#8221; and what it was like to be an adult. Now I&#8217;m halfway through college, haven&#8217;t really lived at home in more than two years, and I&#8217;ve got a job in one of the hippest cities in America.</p>

<p>It feels an awful lot like I&#8217;m growing up. How did that happen? I still remember meeting my roommate on the first day of college.</p>

<p>I see various family members starting relationships, complaining about jobs, making money, drinking a lot, frolicking in the waves, answering work email on the beach, and grilling dinner for other people. They all seem, to various degrees, happy.</p>

<p>Is this success?</p>

<p>Look at some places on Craigslist. Realize they&#8217;re all sketchy or way too expensive. Get confused about the differences and relative strengths of each neighborhood. Think to yourself, &#8220;Well, I suppose I could survive in Outer Richmond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keep looking at places. Think that the Tenderloin might be the only place affordable that&#8217;s actually in the city. Try visiting and decide that living there would be a bad idea.</p>

<p><em>(Throwback: the photo&#8217;s from San Diego&#8217;s Mission Beach in May. I haven&#8217;t taken any photos of Virginia Beach.)</em></p>

<p>So I&#8217;m in Virginia Beach! It feels so weird to leave San Franciso. Virginia Beach is a gorgeous place, but it&#8217;s hard to beat running along the Embarcadero or ordering coffee from the friendly guy at the Civic Center Starbucks who always remembers me.</p>

<p>Wow, Yelp says that location serves the Tenderloin. Ulp.</p>

<p>Beaches on the East Coast are so much warmer than ones in California! It blows my mind. The waves were lame though, so, tradeoffs. I&#8217;ll take California&#8217;s freezing oceans and giant waves anyday.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how to manage (my own) creative work. I&#8217;ve latched on to the entirely unoriginal idea of making short to-do lists that I add to while working on them. This seems flexible enough, and it also keeps me focused on discrete items. If I run into a new idea while in the middle of a task, I can just add it to the list and continue without breaking stride.</p>

<p>Of course the problem with to-do lists is getting in the habit of applying them to all of your problems, not just the ones that are particularly amenable to that solution. Then, even harder, coming up with to-do schedules that work both for me <em>and</em> my boss. Scary.</p>

<p>Also I was going to post a link to an awesome article about the need for self-actualization and how it relates to entrepreneurship, but instead I started reading <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/u-va-board-appoints-interim-leader-mcdonnell-to-talk-with-reporters/2012/06/19/gJQAHAJ3nV_story.html?tid=pm_local_pop">this article</a> and got mad at the phrase, &#8220;in a marathon session.&#8221; Did the entire board of UVA just run 26 miles? Most likely no.</p>

<p>Sloppy journalese is sloppy.</p>

<p>I like beaches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m off to Virginia in five hours for my cousin&#8217;s wedding. It&#8217;s going to be a blast: having fun with cousins, going to a wedding, and enjoying the beautiful weather.</p>

<p>The TV behind me is on some sports game and they&#8217;re playing Kernkraft 400. Completely inappropriate for 1AM in a quiet suburb in Cupertino.</p>

<p>So my cousin&#8217;s getting married, which is awesome, because she&#8217;s awesome, and her guy seems awesome, and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be awesomely happy together. How do people even go about getting married? Whenever I start thinking about relationships I read essays from ThoughtCatalog, which are unceasingly dark and brooding and always make me feel better about my life. Everyone else is crazy too. Here&#8217;s a funny quote:</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss like you’re a starved animal. Imagine you’re kissing a birthday cake, a sno-cone, a Ryan Gosling. Pour all of your attention into the kiss like you’re a conductor leading a makeout orchestra.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Ryan Gosling.</p>

<p><em>You</em> get a Ryan Gosling, <em>you</em> get a Ryan Gosling, <em>everyone</em> gets a Ryan Gosling! And then we&#8217;re going down to the local bar and pretending like we&#8217;re the Chicago Philharmonic.</p>

<p>P.S. Also I appreciate quiet green places a lot more after a week and a half in the city. I need to start waking up earlier and enjoying the mornings.</p>

<p>(One of the cool things about <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">this blog software</a> is that posts can be published whenever I want. Was this actually written on Tuesday? Nope.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to follow in the steps of my friend <a href="http://jessepollak.me/">Jesse Pollak</a> and blog every day this summer. Jesse&#8217;s a great guy, brilliant developer, working at BuzzFeed for HackNY this summer.</p>

<p>Writing blog entries is tough. I&#8217;m much more used to journalistic writing, where the sentences are simple and the facts are clear. Blogging is a different type of writing: I&#8217;m not trying to convey a series of facts, but rather some muddled snapshot of what&#8217;s in my head at the time.</p>

<p>Another awesome person you should follow is Lauren Moon, who blogs at <a href="http://laurenistwentysomething.blogspot.com/">Lauren Is Twenty-Something</a>! Basically she&#8217;s an amazing writer. I think she&#8217;s doing like five million unpaid internships in the entertainment industry this summer, or something. What a boss.</p>

			<p><img src="/images/sf-cada-uno-tiene-un-sueno.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve walked past this mural every day so far on my way to work)</p>

<p>My school wants to know how to brand itself. I took a group call with other current students and an external marketing research group. The researcher asked us questions like, &#8220;Academics?&#8221;, and &#8220;Are you a New England college?&#8221;, and, my favorite, &#8220;What do Pomona students care about?&#8221;</p>

<p>What do Pomona students care about? I can&#8217;t help but feel that if the college has to hire an external party to figure this out, they&#8217;re doing something wrong.</p>

<p>I had a great conversation with one of my bosses at <a href="http://getchute.com">Chute</a> about his sales strategy. He said, essentially, that he was in the business of forming strong relationships with people. Strong relationships build a strong company.</p>

<p>I feel like a lot of complaints students have with the administration comes down to a lack of good relationships. The outcry about the documentation checks and administration accountability at the end of Fall semester were worsened because students don&#8217;t feel connected with parts of the administration.</p>

<p>At the end of the call, someone else added something I really identified with. They said that Pomona could stand to loosen the reigns and let its students have a bigger impact on the school and community. The Motley at Scripps is student-run, does what it wants, lets students paint all over its walls.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to paint the walls on something at Pomona.</p>

<p>Today at work I made pretty (and useful) graphs. San Francisco fuck yeah!</p>

<p>Just had a gorgeous run along the waterfront, with the fog coming in and everything. This city is such a strange mélange: from the tall buildings of Embarcadero, past the cliffs of Telegraph Hill, through the crowds of awkard tourists at Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf, to the foggy peace of Fort Mason, and back through the cozy tree-covered streetlamp-lit streets of Nob Hill. The droning cable car tracks led me back home.</p>

<p>I saw a great quote at NikeWorld at Union Square yesterday: &#8220;If you have a body, you are an athelete.&#8221; — Bill Bowerman. If you ever find yourself needing for inspiration, get over to your closest Nike Store, that shit&#8217;s great.</p>

			<p>I just updated <a href="http://tsl.pomona.edu">The Student Life website</a>, finally posting the set of <a href="http://tsl.pomona.edu/pages/about#community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> we&#8217;ve been working on. Ocassionally comment threads get heated, especially on articles about race, sex, or politics. One complaint I heard was that commenters felt that there wasn&#8217;t any positive moderation, so the trolls took over the threads. We&#8217;re now more actively moderating the comments to encourage positive, healthy discussions.</p>

<p>The new guidelines are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Be a good person</em>. The Consortium is a nice place. We are nice people. Debate the ideas, not the person.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you attack another person, we will ask you to edit or remove your comment. If you don&#8217;t respond, we don&#8217;t have an easy way to contact you, or you refuse, we will edit or remove the comment ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are a spambot, we will remove your comments. This means you, &#8220;second hand cars manchester&#8221;!</p>

		<h1><a href="">The Looping Problem, Using Python Iterators</a></h1>
		<div class="post-body">
			<p>Let&#8217;s look at the classic Looping Problem: given a singly-linked list, how do we tell if it loops or not? The naïve way is to keep track of every node you&#8217;ve already seen, but for fun let&#8217;s do it in constant memory!</p>

<p><a href="http://ostermiller.org/find_loop_singly_linked_list.html">There are a lot of solutions</a>, and I&#8217;m going to talk about two of them. You can check every node before the current one, or you can use a &#8220;tortoise and hare&#8221; method where one iterator iterates twice as fast as the other. The link above gives the algorithms in a pseudo-Java language, but in Python you can write them a lot more succinctly with iterators.</p>

<p>You should use iterators because they make the purpose of your code clearer. Does your code check loops, or increment <code>i</code> a bunch of times? The less extra cruft, the better (you probably already know this, which is why you use Python instead of C or Java).</p>

<p>Both of the following examples make use of the Python built-in module <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html">itertools</a>, which provides lazy iterators and some other cool stuff. If you&#8217;re not using it already, you should be!</p>

<h2 id="solution-1-check-every-node-youve-already-seen">Solution 1: Check every node you&#8217;ve already seen</h2>

<p>This solutions runs in O(N^2), but it&#8217;s nice because it&#8217;s easy to understand. For each node, we iterate through every node up to just before the current node, checking for matches. If we find any, then we have a loop.</p>

<p>In Python, you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice">itertools.islice</a> to lazily take the first n elements of a sequence. Combining this with the built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#enumerate">enumerate</a>, which adds indices to an iterator, you can write this algorithm as:</p>

<p>{% highlight python %}
from itertools import islice
def is_loop(node):
	for i, node in enumerate(seq):
		if node in islice(seq, i):
			return True
	return False
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="solution-2-the-tortoise-and-the-hare">Solution 2: The tortoise and the hare</h2>

<p>This one runs in O(N). You keep two iterators referencing the same linked-list, and advance one iterator faster than the other. If there&#8217;s a loop, the faster iterator will loop around and catch up with the slower iterator.</p>

<p>In Python, the key is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.izip">itertools.izip</a>, a lazy version of <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#zip">the built-in function zip</a>. Zip constructs an iterator yielding an element from both sequences at the same time—for example, <code>zip([1,2], [a, b])</code> would give you <code>[(1,'a'), (2, 'b')]</code>. This algorithm needs the lazy version because if you do have a loop, then trying to construct a list will eventually make the Python interpreter run out of memory.</p>

<p>I also define a function <code>skip</code> that creates the fast iterator. It lazily yields the elements of a sequence, skipping n elements every time. Calling <code>skip(seq, 1)</code> gives you an iterator that goes twice as fast as a normal iterator.</p>

<p>The <code>skip</code> function also shows off some cool underlying features of Python:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#iter">iter</a> function turns any collection into an iterator, so all you have to give <code>skip</code> is some object which supports <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__">the iteration protocol</a>. Any object with an <code>__iter__</code> method can be turned into an iterator.</p>

<p>You might be curious about the infinite while loop—what happens when it reaches the end of the list? When an iterator runs out of available elements, it raises the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.StopIteration">StopIteration</a> exception. Since the <code>skip</code> function doesn&#8217;t catch it, it&#8217;s essentially as though it raises the exception itself, which is exactly what it&#8217;s supposed to do when it reaches the end of the list.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the solution:</p>

<p>{% highlight python %}
def skip(seq, n):
	seq = iter(seq)
	while True:
		yield next(seq)
		for i in xrange(n):
			next(seq)</p>

<p>from itertools import izip
def is_loop(seq):
    for slow_node, fast_node in izip(seq, skip(seq, 1)):
        if slow_node == fast_node:
            return True
    return False
{% endhighlight %}</p>

		<h1><a href="">Five-College Menu FAQ</a></h1>
		<div class="post-body">
			<p><strong>Q: Do you update it manually?</strong></p>

<p>I do not! That would be ridiculous. Can you imagine? I have a hard enough time just getting up early for class.</p>

<p>I have an automated program that does it for me.</p>

<p><strong>Q: It&#8217;s a web scraper, right?</strong></p>

<p>Yep. I wrote it in the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> programming language, using _why the lucky stiff&#8217;s awesome <a href="https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot">Hpricot</a> HTML parsing library.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have no idea what that means.</strong></p>

<p>No worries! Basically, it looks at the menus, figures out where the important things are, and copies them. Then it puts everything together into one page.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same thing a human would do, just more computer-y.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why are you doing this?</strong></p>

<p>I find it useful, and people like it. It&#8217;s costs me almost nothing to host, and it updates automatically, so it doesn&#8217;t take much of my time or money. It&#8217;s also fun!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why did you make this?</strong></p>

<p>Most days fall semester, my buddy Mike McGuinness would come by before lunch and ask if I wanted to go to Scripps. I would always ask what they had, he would reply he didn&#8217;t know, and we&#8217;d look it up. Once we were looking at the Scripps site, we&#8217;d start checking the others as well.</p>

<p>One night, I copied the menu for Frank, threw together a site, and showed Mike. He thought it was awesome. Seven hours later I bought mikemaltese.com and put the 5C Menu online.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you a computer science major?</strong></p>

<p>Nope. I&#8217;m currently thinking Applied Math, with an Econ minor.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why the dinosaur?</strong></p>

<p>To add color. And dinosaurs are cool. (Like bowties.)</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you know that guy?</strong></p>

<p>Do you mean <a href="http://fairlyawesome.com/">Joseph Long</a>, creator of the <a href="http://aspc.pomona.edu/courses/">Our Pomona</a> course search site? Indeed I do. He&#8217;s a cool guy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Isn&#8217;t your name Michael? What&#8217;s with Mike?</strong></p>

<p>Sadly, michaelmaltese.com is taken.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 2nd on Google for the query “mike maltese,” so it was a good choice.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 8th for “michael maltese,” below results for the guy who wrote Looney Tunes and the guy who killed his parents in Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s up with these questions?</strong></p>

<p>People actually ask me these all the time. Especially the one about me manually updating it, though all of them pop up.</p>
