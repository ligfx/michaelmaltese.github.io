	<p class="meta">19 Jan 2011 &ndash; Claremont</p>

	<p><strong>Q: Do you update it manually?</strong></p>

<p>I do not! That would be ridiculous. Can you imagine? I have a hard enough time just getting up early for class.</p>

<p>I have an automated program that does it for me.</p>

<p><strong>Q: It's a web scraper, right?</strong></p>

<p>Yep. I wrote it in the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> programming language, using _why the lucky stiff's awesome <a href="https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot">Hpricot</a> HTML parsing library.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have no idea what that means.</strong></p>

<p>No worries! Basically, it looks at the menus, figures out where the important things are, and copies them. Then it puts everything together into one page.</p>

<p>It's the same thing a human would do, just more computer-y.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why are you doing this?</strong></p>

<p>I find it useful, and people like it. It's costs me almost nothing to host, and it updates automatically, so it doesn't take much of my time or money. It's also fun!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why did you make this?</strong></p>

<p>Most days fall semester, my buddy Mike McGuinness would come by before lunch and ask if I wanted to go to Scripps. I would always ask what they had, he would reply he didn't know, and we'd look it up. Once we were looking at the Scripps site, we'd start checking the others as well.</p>

<p>One night, I copied the menu for Frank, threw together a site, and showed Mike. He thought it was awesome. Seven hours later I bought mikemaltese.com and put the 5C Menu online.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you a computer science major?</strong></p>

<p>Nope. I'm currently thinking Applied Math, with an Econ minor.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why the dinosaur?</strong></p>

<p>To add color. And dinosaurs are cool. (Like bowties.)</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you know that guy?</strong></p>

<p>Do you mean <a href="http://fairlyawesome.com/">Joseph Long</a>, creator of the <a href="http://aspc.pomona.edu/courses/">Our Pomona</a> course search site? Indeed I do. He's a cool guy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Isn't your name Michael? What's with Mike?</strong></p>

<p>Sadly, michaelmaltese.com is taken.</p>

<p>I'm 2nd on Google for the query “mike maltese,” so it was a good choice.</p>

<p>I'm 8th for “michael maltese,” below results for the guy who wrote Looney Tunes and the guy who killed his parents in Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What's up with these questions?</strong></p>

<p>People actually ask me these all the time. Especially the one about me manually updating it, though all of them pop up.</p>
